1. A data science student is using two machine learning algorithms to analyze a given
dataset. First, she tests her model with a Decision Tree using a 10-fold Cross Validation
and records the Accuracy for each fold. She then repeats the same process using a 12-fold
Logistic Regression algorithm on the same dataset. The accuracy for each fold of the
algorithms are given as follows:
Decision Tree: 75, 79, 69, 78, 65, 87, 74, 81, 77, 88
Logistic Regression: 85, 68, 78, 73, 69, 76, 69, 80, 73, 67, 78, 82
(a) Is the dataset paired or unpaired?
(b) Can she conclude that either one of the machine learning algorithm is more accurate
than the other?
i. Create vectors for each algorithm. Check the means of the accuracy reported
for the two models.
ii. Run wilcox.test command to check the significance of the comparison.

```{r}
DT<- c(75,79,69,78,65,87,74,81,77,88)
LR<- c(85,68,78,73,69,76,69,80,73,67,78,82)
mean(DT)
mean(LR)
```
```{r}
wilcox.test(LR, DT)
```
```{r}
wilcox.test(LR, DT, exact= F)
```
```{r}
a <- c(159, 135, 141, 101, 102, 168, 62, 167, 174, 159, 66, 118,
181, 171, 112)
b <- c(214, 159, 169, 202, 103, 119, 200, 109, 132, 142, 194, 104,
219, 119, 234)
wilcox.test(a,b,paired=TRUE)
```
3. Suppose you want to compare two software Zip and Tar on archiving files. For our
experiment we collect 20 files and execute Zip and Tar on these files. The execution time
(time from the beginning till the end of the archiving files in milliseconds) is recorded as
follows:
Zip execution time: 10, 44, 65, 77, 43, 44, 22, 66, 50, 100, 55, 99, 44, 23, 100, 88, 200,
220, 110, 551
Tar execution time: 20, 55, 75, 60, 55, 88, 35, 33, 35, 80, 65, 82, 47, 35, 97, 110, 250,
190, 111, 600
Your task is to find out if there is any significant difference in the execution times of
these two different archiving programs based on their running time on the same files.
(a) Are these two groups of samplings paired or independent? Why?
(b) Assuming that the data is not normally distributed, use wilcox.test test to calculate the p-value. Based on the significant level of Î± = 0.05, what do you conclude
about differences between the mean of run-time of two different archiving programs?
These two groups are paired, as the runtime is calculated based on archiving the same
files.
```{r}
zip <- c(10, 44, 65, 77, 43, 44, 22, 66, 50, 100, 55, 99, 44, 23,
100, 88, 200, 220, 110, 551)
tar <- tar <- c(20, 55, 75, 60, 55, 88, 35, 33, 35, 80, 65, 82,
47, 35, 97, 110, 250, 190, 111, 600)


```


```{r}
wilcox.test(zip,tar, paired=TRUE)

```
